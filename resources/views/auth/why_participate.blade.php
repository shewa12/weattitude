        <h3>Case Study 1: Career Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
Jenny is a full time nurse at Beckford medical center in Memphis, Tennessee. She traces her roots back to Scotland; her great grandmother migrated from Scotland to the U.S.A. about 150 years ago.
        </p>        
        <p>
Jenny heard about WEattitude.org from a colleague at the hospital. She decided to spare an hour a week on WEattitude projects in Scotland. Specifically, Jenny utilizes her knowledge from her nursing profession to offer some guidance for health-related projects focused on cancer and heart-disease in Scotland.

        </p>        
        <p>
Many years later, using Ancestry DNA test kit, Jenny becomes informed about some relatives in Scotland she had never heard about. She goes to visit twice in the same year. She eventually decides to relocate to Scotland.

        </p>        
        <p>
Her biggest dilemma at this point was how to find a job she is passionate about in Scotland. She reaches out to a number of people she's been collaborating with on WEattitude.org; she got 3 job offers in Scotland within 2 weeks! It turned out that WEattitude.org members have a huge tendency to assist other WEattitude.org members in any way they can.

        <h3>Case Study 2: Skill Development </h3>
        <p>

Chidi's 9-5 job is as a data scientist. The company he works for is a wholesaler of female comfort shoes. His job involves analyzing customer data to identify opportunities for the company to maximize sales. This involves identifying where and how best for the company to advertise its products, how best to price the shoes, what types of shoe designs should be sold in each region, how much inventory to carry for each design in each part of the country etc.
  </p>
  <p>
He is happy with the team he works with; his co-workers and his manager, in his opinion, are great. He loves the skillsets he utilizes at the office too; he likes that it is challenging and keeps his brain active. However, he will like to do much more with his skillsets than help women find the best shoes. So he joined WEattitude.org</p>
<p>
For about 3 months in a year, he commits a couple of hours per week, applying the same general data analysis skills from his job to philanthropic projects aimed at tackling terrorism in 3 countries in the Middle East. His analysis now not only saves lives in the Middle East but also in Western countries too where these terrorism camps from the Middle East are trying to infiltrate.
Chidi is much happier now; he is developing and expanding his skillset while also helping the world.

        <h3>Case Study 3: Self Fulfilment</h3>
        <p>

Hadiya is the first of 3 girls in her family. She loves to paint and bake.</p>
<p>
She is looked upon by many young girls as a role model; perhaps due to her informal role as a part-time mother to her 2 younger sisters, or due to her exemplary life style.
She enjoys being a beacon of decency to growing girls. Nothing gives her a greater sense of fulfilment and purpose in life. She has a special satisfaction from serving a cause greater than herself.</p>
<p>
This is why she joined WEattitude.org where she volunteers as a mentor for young girls in various regions of the world including North and South America, Europe and East Africa. Amongst other things, she encourages the young girls she mentors to think positively and aspire to uplift their societies. Amongst other things, she guides them online to paint and bake or take up interests that keeps them positively engaged and away from the negativities of their societies.</p>

        <h3>Case Study 5: Networking and Exposure for Success</h3>
        <p>

Ahmed, a long-time member of WEattitude.org, has built a vibrant personal WEattitude.org network through his communication with other members while collaborating on a series of projects.</p>
<p>
Thus when Ahmed started his online business selling t-shirts with motivational quotes written on them, his network of over 2000 fellow volunteers at WEattitude.org supported him by buying his product and spreading the word.</p>
<p>
In addition, because the product, motivational t-shirts, is in line with WEattitude.org's philosophy, his products are listed on WEattitude.org's online web store - thus exposing the product to over a million individuals who visit WEattitude.org website weekly
